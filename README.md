# Lunar-calibration
Calibration of satellite-borne radiometer is a key issue for quantitative remote sensing. Its accuracy depends on the stability of the calibration source. Because of no atmosphere and biological activity, the Moon surface keeps stable in the long term and may be a good candidate for thermal calibration.
Lunar regolith media has been modeled as uniformly inhomogeneous media with density, heat capacity and heat conductivity profiles. The heat conduction equation is solved to obtain the temperature profile of the regolith. The simulated surface temperature can be validated by the Diviner T7 data (channel 7) and the temperature at the depth measured in the Apollo borehole experiment (See Liu, Fa and Jin, 2018, TGRS,DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2018.2880116). The microwave brightness temperature is simulated with the radiative transfer equation. The loss tangent is fitted by the Change'2 microwave birghtness temperature along the lunar equator at the noon and validated by the Change'2 measurement at other latitude. (See Liu, Fa and Jin, 2018, TGRS,DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2018.2880116)
The global microwave brightness temperature of the Moon is simulated. The simulated brightness temperature is validated by the observation from the microwave humidity sounder onboard the NOAA-18 satellite. We hope the simulation can be used for the calibration of the space-borne microwave radiometers and the Earth-based telescope array.
